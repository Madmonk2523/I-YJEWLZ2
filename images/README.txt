This folder is intentionally left with no local images.

During development, the site injects placeholder images from https://picsum.photos for all missing images, so pages render nicely without local assets.

To replace with real images later:
- Put your .jpg/.png files in this folder, matching the filenames referenced in the HTML (e.g., hero1.jpg, category-rings.jpg, product1.jpg, etc.), or
- Update the inline background-image URLs in HTML or swap the JS to use your CDN paths.

Tip: Keep file names human-readable and consistent (e.g., product12.jpg, team1.jpg).
